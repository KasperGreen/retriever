This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) web app for retrieving JSON data from UE4 manifest.json and composing a new manifest.json with recursively collected dependencies of the entered asset title.

Built using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) and [destr](https://github.com/unjs/destr) as JSON.parse alternative.
